The first twist in knitting these new patterns is to distinguish between 
thinking and cognition. Thinking, as I use the term, refers to high- level 
mental operations such as reasoning abstractly, creating and using 
verbal languages, constructing mathematical theorems, composing 
music, and the like, operations associated with higher consciousness. 
Although Homo sapiens may not be unique in these abilities, humans 
possess them in greater degree and with more extensive development 
than other species. Cognition, by contrast, is a much broader faculty 
present to some degree in all biological life- forms and many technical 
systems. This vision overlaps with the position that Humberto Mat-
urana and Francisco Varela articulated in their classic work on cogni-
tion and autopoiesis (1980). It also aligns with the emerging science of 
cognitive biology, which views all organisms as engaging in systematic 
acts of cognition as they interact with their environments. The field, 
named by Brian C. Goodwin (1977), has subsequently been developed 
by the Slovakian scientist Ladislav Kováč (2000, hereafter referred to
