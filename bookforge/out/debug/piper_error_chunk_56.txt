The advantages of this perspective include breaking out of an an-
thropocentric view of cognition and building bridges across different 
phyla to construct a comparative view of cognition. As formulated 
by Pamela Lyon and Jonathan Opie (2007), cognitive biology offers 
a framework consistent with empirical results: "Mounting evidence
