Cognition as formulated in cognitive biology employs some of the 
same terms as mainstream views but radically alters their import. 
Traditionally, cognition is associated with human thought; William 
James, for example, noted that "cognition is a function of conscious-
ness" ([1909] 1975, 13). Moreover, it is often defined as an "act of know-
ing" that includes "perception and judgment" ("Cognition," in En-
cyclopedia Britannica, www .britannica .com /topic /cognition - thought 
- process). A very different perspective informs the principles of cog-
nitive biology. Consider, for example, Kováč's observation that even a 
unicellular organism "must have a certain minimal knowledge of the 
relevant features of the environment," resulting in a correspondence, 
"however coarse- grained and abstract," between these features and 
the molecules of which it is comprised. He concludes, "In general, 
at all levels of life, not just at the level of nucleic acid molecules, a 
complexity, which serves a specific function . . . corresponds to an 
embodied knowledge, translated into the constructions of a system. The 
environment is a rich set of potential niches: each niche is a problem 
to be solved, to survive in the niche means to solve the problem, and 
the solution is the embodied knowledge, an algorithm of how to act 
in order to survive" ("FP," 59). In this view cognition is not limited to 
humans or organisms with consciousness; it extends to all life- forms, 
including those lacking central nervous systems, such as plants and 
microorganisms.
