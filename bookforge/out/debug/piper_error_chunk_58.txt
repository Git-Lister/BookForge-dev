‘testing' all the possibilities of how to advance ahead" ("FP," 58). In a 
playful extension of this reasoning, he imagines a bacterial philoso-
pher confronting the same issues concerning its onticity as a human, 
asking whether the world exists, and if so, why there is something 
rather than nothing. Like the human, the bacterium can find no ab-
solute answers within its purview; it nevertheless pursues "its onticity 
in the world" and accordingly "is already a subject, facing the world 
as an object. At all levels, from the simplest to the most complex, the 
overall construction of the subject, the embodiment of the achieved 
knowledge, represents its epistemic complexity" ("FP," 59). The sum to-
tal of the world's epistemic complexity is continually increasing, ac-
cording to Kováč, advanced by the testing of what he calls the beliefs 
of organisms: "only some of the constructions of organisms are em-
bodied knowledge, the others are but embodied beliefs. . . . If we take 
a mutation in a bacterium as a new belief about the environment, we 
can say that the mutant would sacrifice its life to prove its fidelity to 
that belief" ("FP," 63). If it continues to survive, that belief becomes 
converted into embodied knowledge and, as such, is passed along to 
the next generation.
